# Modern cloud apps hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will be challenged to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Azure App Services, Microsoft Azure Functions, Azure SQL Database, Azure Logic Apps, and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, workflows, and monitoring, using various components of Microsoft Azure.

Please note that as opposed to the whiteboard design session, the lab is not focused on maintaining PCI compliance and using more advanced security features such as App Service Environment, Network Security Groups, and Application Gateway. The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members working on the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

By the end of this hands-on lab, you will have learned how to use several key services within Azure to improve overall functionality of the original solution, and to increase the security and scalability of the new and improved design.

## Overview

The Cloud Workshop: Modern Cloud Apps lab is a hands-on exercise that will challenge you to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Microsoft Azure App Services and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, security, and scale using various components of Microsoft Azure. The lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with additional team members to more closely model a real-world experience, and to allow members to share their expertise for the overall solution.

## Solution architecture

Azure AD Org is used for authentication to the call center app. Azure AD B2C for authentication is used for authentication to the client app. SQL Database for the backend customer data. Azure App Services for the web and API apps. Order processing includes using Functions, Logic Apps, Queues and Storage. Azure App Insights is used for telemetry capture.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image2.png "Solution Architecture Diagram")
